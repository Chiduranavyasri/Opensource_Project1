## ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION 

### Introduction 

In the previous chapter, we have learnt that whenever an electric current flows through a conductor, it produces a magnetic field around it. This was discovered by Christian Oersted. Later, Ampere proved that a current-carrying loop behaves like a bar magnet. These are the magnetic effects produced by the electric current.

_itic in experimental science if we only allow her all unbiased on our minds”_ ― Michael Faraday

Physicists then began to think of the converse effect. Is it possible to produce an electric current with the help of a magnetic field? A series of experiments were conducted to establish the converse effect. These experiments were done by Michael Faraday of UK and Joseph Henry of USA, almost simultaneously and independently. These attempts became successful and led to the discovery of the phenomenon, called Electromagnetic Induction. Michael Faraday is credited with the discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831.




  

In this chapter, let us see a few experiments of Faraday, the results and the phenomenon of Electromagnetic Induction. Before that, we will recollect the concept of magnetic flux linked with a surface area.

**An anecdote!**

Michael Faraday was enormously popular for his lectures as well. In one of his lectures, he demonstrated his experiments which led to the discovery of electromagnetic induction.

At the end of the lecture, one member of the audience approached Faraday and said, “Mr. Faraday, the behaviour of the magnet and the coil of wire was interesting, but what is the use of it?” Faraday answered politely, “Sir, what is the use of a newborn baby?” **Note:** We will soon see the greatness of ‘that little child’ who has now grown as an adult to cater to the energy needs.

### Magnetic Flux (**F**B)

The magnetic flux FB through an area _A_ in a magnetic field is defined as the number of magnetic field lines passing through that area normally and is given by the equation (Figure 4.1(a)).

where the integral is taken over the area _A_ and _θ_ is the angle between the direction of the magnetic field and the outward normal to the area.

The SI unit of magnetic flux is T m2. It is also measured in weber or Wb_._

1 Wb = 1 T m2

**EXAMPLE 4.1**

A circular antenna of area 3 m2 is installed at a place in Madurai. The plane of the area of antenna is inclined at 47o with the direction of Earth’s magnetic field. If the magnitude of Earth’s field at that place is 4.1 × 10–5 T find the magnetic flux linked with the antenna.

**_Solution_**

_B_ = 4.1 × 10–5 T; _θ_ = 90o – 47o = 43°; _A_ = 3m2

### Faraday’s Experiments on Electromagnetic Induction

**First Experiment** Consider a closed circuit consisting of a

coil _C_ of insulated wire and a galvanometer _G_ (Figure 4.2(a)). The galvanometer does not indicate deflection as there is no electric current in the circuit.

When a bar magnet is inserted into the stationary coil, with its north pole facing the coil, there is a momentary deflection in the galvanometer. This indicates that an electric current is set up in the coil (Figure 4.2(b)). If the magnet is kept stationary inside the

coil, the galvanometer does not indicate deflection (Figure 4.2(c)).

The bar magnet is now withdrawn from the coil, the galvanometer again gives a momentary deflection but in the opposite direction. So the electric current flows in opposite direction (Figure 4.2(d)). Now if the magnet is moved faster, it gives a larger deflection due to a greater current in the circuit (Figure 4.2(e))

The bar magnet is reversed i.e., the south pole now faces the coil. When the above experiment is repeated, the deflections are opposite to that obtained in the case of north pole (Figure 4.2(f)).

If the magnet is kept stationary and the coil is moved towards or away from the coil, similar results are obtained. It is concluded that whenever there is a relative motion between the coil and the magnet, there is deflection in the galvanometer, indicating the electric current setup in the coil.

**Second Experiment** Consider two closed circuits as shown

in Figure 4.3(a). The circuit consisting of a coil _P_, a battery _B_ and a key _K_ is called as primary circuit while the circuit with a coil _S_ and a galvanometer _G_ is known as secondary circuit. The coils _P_ and _S_ are kept at rest in close proximity with respect to one another.

If the primary circuit is closed, electric current starts flowing in the primary circuit. At that time, the galvanometer gives a momentary deflection (Figure 4.3(a)).

After that, when the electric current reaches a certain steady value, no deflection is observed in the galvanometer.

Likewise if the primary circuit is broken, the electric current starts decreasing and there is again a sudden deflection but in the opposite direction (Figure 4.3(b)).

When the electric current becomes zero, the galvanometer shows no deflection.

From the above observations, it is concluded that whenever the electric current in the primary circuit changes, the galvanometer shows a deflection.

**Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction**

From the results of his experiments, Faraday realized that **whenever the magnetic flux linked with a closed coil changes, an emf (electromotive force) is induced and hence an electric current flows in the circuit. This current is called an induced current and the emf giving rise to such current is called an induced emf. This phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction.**

**Figure 4.4 Explanation of Faraday’s first expe**

Based on this idea, Faraday’s experiments are understood in the following way. In the first experiment, when a bar magnet is placed close to a coil, some of the magnetic field lines of the bar magnet pass through the coil i.e., the magnetic flux is linked with the coil. When the bar magnet and the coil approach each other, the magnetic flux linked with the coil increases. So this increase in magnetic flux induces an emf and hence a transient electric current flows in the circuit in one direction (Figure 4.4(a)).

At the same time, when they recede away from one another, the magnetic flux linked with the coil decreases. The decrease in magnetic flux again induces an emf in opposite  

direction and hence an electric current flows in opposite direction (Figure 4.4(b)). So there is deflection in the galvanometer when there is a relative motion between the coil and the magnet.

In the second experiment, when the primary coil _P_ carries an electric current, a magnetic field is established around it. The magnetic lines of this field pass through itself and the neighbouring secondary coil _S_.

When the primary circuit is open, no electric current flows in it and hence the magnetic flux linked with the secondary coil is zero (Figure 4.5(a)).

However, when the primary circuit is closed, the increasing current builds up a

magnetic field around the primary coil. Therefore, the magnetic flux linked with the secondary coil increases. This increasing flux linked induces a transient electric current in the secondary coil (Figure 4.5(b)). When the electric current in the primary coil reaches a steady value, the magnetic flux linked with the secondary coil does not change and the electric current in the secondary coil will disappear.

Similarly, when the primary circuit is broken, the decreasing primary current

induces an electric current in the secondary coil, but in the opposite direction (Figure 4.5(c)). So there is deflection in the galvanometer whenever there is a change in the primary current.

The conclusions of Faraday’s experiments are stated as two laws.

**First law Whenever magnetic flux linked with a closed circuit changes, an emf is induced in the circuit which lasts in the circuit as long as the magnetic flux is changing.**

**Second law The magnitude of induced emf in a closed circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux linked with the circuit.**

**Importance of Electromagnetic Induction!**

The application of the phenomenon of Electromagnetic Induction is almost everywhere in the present day life. Right from home appliances to huge factory machineries, from cellphone to computers and internet, from electric guitar to satellite communication, all need electricity for their operation. There is an ever growing demand for electric power.

All these are met with the help of electric generators and transformers which function on electromagnetic induction. The modern, sophisticated human life would not be possible without the discovery of electromagnetic induction.

**Exploring Electromagnetic Induction**

**N S**

Make a circuit containing a coil of insulated wire wound around soft hollow core and a galvanometer as shown in Figure. It is better to use a thin wire for the coil so that we can wind many turns in the available space. Perform the steps described in first experiment of Faraday with the help of a strong bar magnet. Students will get hands-on experience about electromagnetic induction.

**Activity**  

**EXAMPLE 4.3**

A cylindrical bar magnet is kept along the axis of a circular solenoid. If the magnet is rotated about its axis, find out whether an electric current is induced in the coil. **_Solution_**

The magnetic field of a cylindrical magnet is symmetrical about its axis. As the magnet is rotated along the axis of the solenoid, there is no induced current in the solenoid because the flux linked with the solenoid does not change due to the rotation of the magnet.

**EXAMPLE 4.4**

A closed coil of 40 turns and of area 200 cm2, is rotated in a magnetic field of flux density 2 Wb m–2. It rotates from a position where its plane makes an angle of 30o with the field to a position perpendicular to the field in a time 0.2 s. Find the magnitude of the emf induced in the coil due to its rotation.

**EXAMPLE 4.5**

A straight conducting wire is dropped horizontally from a certain height with its length along east – west direction. Will an emf be induced in it? Justify your answer.

**_Solution_**

Yes! An emf will be induced in the wire because it moves perpendicular to the horizontal component of Earth’s magnetic field and hence it cuts the magnetic lines of Earth's magnetic filed.

### Lenz’s law

A German physicist Heinrich Lenz performed a series of experiments on electromagnetic induction and deduced a law to determine the direction of the induced current. This law is known as Lenz’s law.

**Lenz’s law states that the direction of the induced current is such that it always opposes the cause responsible for its production.**

Faraday discovered that whenever magnetic flux linked with a coil changes, an electric current is induced in the circuit. Here the flux change is the cause while the induction of current is the effect. Lenz’s law says that the effect always opposes the cause. Therefore, the induced current would flow in a direction so that it could oppose the flux change.

By incorporating Lenz's law into Faraday's law, the equation (4.2) is rewritten as

=− _d N_

_dt B_( ) (4.3)

The negative sign signifies that the direction of induced emf is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux.

To understand Lenz’s law, let us consider two illustrations in which we  

find the direction of the induced current in a circuit.

**Illustration 1**

Consider a uniform magnetic field, with its field lines perpendicular to the plane of the paper and pointing inwards. These field lines are represented by crosses (x) as shown in Figure 4.6(a). A rectangular metallic frame _ABCD_ is placed in this magnetic field,

with its plane perpendicular to the field. The arm _AB_ is movable so that it can slide towards right or left.

If the arm AB slides to our right side, the number of field lines (magnetic flux) passing through the frame _ABCD_ increases and a current is induced. As suggested by Lenz’s law, the induced current opposes this flux increase and it tries to reduce it by producing **another magnetic field pointing outwards i.e., opposite to the existing magnetic field.**

The magnetic lines of this induced field are represented by red-colored circles in the Figure 4.6(b). From the direction of the magnetic field thus produced, the direction of the induced current is found to be anti-clockwise by using right-hand thumb rule.

The leftward motion of arm _AB_ decreases magnetic flux. The induced current, this time, produces **a magnetic field in the inward direction** (**red-colored crosses) i.e., in the direction of the existing magnetic field** (Figure 4.6(c)). Therefore, the flux decrease is opposed by the flow of induced current. From this, it is found that induced current flows in clockwise direction.

**Illustration 2** Let us move a bar magnet towards

the solenoid, with its north pole pointing the solenoid (Figure 4.7(b)). This motion increases the magnetic flux of the coil which in turn, induces an electric current. Due to the flow of induced current, the coil becomes a magnetic dipole whose two magnetic poles are on either end of the coil.

In this case, the cause producing the induced current is the movement of the magnet. According to Lenz’s law, the induced

current should flow in such a way that it opposes the movement of the north pole towards coil. It is possible if the end nearer to the magnet becomes north pole (Figure 4.7(b)). Then it repels the north pole of the




  

bar magnet and opposes the movement of the magnet. Once pole ends are known, the direction of the induced current could be found by using right hand thumb rule.

When the bar magnet is withdrawn, the nearer end becomes south pole which attracts north pole of the bar magnet, opposing the receding motion of the magnet (Figure 4.7(c)).

Thus the direction of the induced current can be found from Lenz’s law.

**Conservation of energy** The truth of Lenz’s law can be established

on the basis of the law of conservation of energy. The explanation is as follows: According to Lenz’s law, when a magnet is moved either towards or away from a coil, the induced current produced opposes its motion. As a result, there will always be a resisting force on the moving magnet. Work has to be done by some external agency to move the magnet against this resisting force. Here the mechanical energy of the moving magnet is converted into the electrical energy which in turn, gets converted into Joule heat in the coil i.e., energy is converted from one form to another.

On the contrary to Lenz’s law, let us assume that the induced current _helps_ the cause responsible for its production. Now when we push the magnet little bit towards the coil, the induced current helps the movement of the magnet towards the coil. Then the magnet starts moving towards the coil without any expense of energy. This, then, becomes a perpetual motion machine. In practice, no such machine is possible. Therefore, the assumption that the induced current _helps_ the cause is wrong. Thus Lenz's law is an excellent example of conservation of energy.  

### Fleming’s right hand rule

When a conductor moves in a magnetic field, the direction of motion of the conductor, the field and the induced current are given by Fleming’s right hand rule and is as follows:

**Direction of motion of the conductor**

**Direction of eld**

**Direction of Current**

**N**

**N S**

**S**

**Current**

![Fleming’s right hand rule](4.8.png "")

**The thumb, index finger and middle finger of right hand are stretched out in mutually perpendicular directions (as shown in Figure 4.8). If the index finger points the direction of the magnetic field and the thumb indicates the direction of motion of the conductor, then the middle finger will indicate the direction of the induced current.**

Fleming’s right hand rule is also known as generator rule.

**EXAMPLE 4.6**

If the current _i_ flowing in the straight conducting wire as shown in the figure decreases, find out the direction of induced current in the metallic square loop placed near it.




  

**Demonstration of Lenz’s law** Take a narrow copper pipe and a

strongly magnetized button magnet as shown in figure. Keep the copper pipe vertical and drop the magnet into the pipe. Watch the motion of the magnet and note that magnet has become slower than its free fall. The reason is that an electric current generated by a moving magnet will always _oppose_ the original motion of the magnet that produced the current.

**Activity**

_i_

**_Solution_** From right hand rule, the magnetic field by the straight wire is directed into the plane of the square loop perpendicularly and its magnetic flux is decreasing. The decrease in flux is opposed by the current induced in the loop by producing a magnetic field in the same direction as the magnetic field of the wire. Again from right hand rule, for this inward magnetic field, the direction of the induced current in the loop is clockwise.

ε  

**EXAMPLE 4.7**

The magnetic flux passes perpendicular to the plane of the circuit and is directed into the paper. If the magnetic flux varies with respect to time as per the following relation: Φ_B t t t_\= + + +( )2 3 8 53 2 mWb , what is the magnitude of the induced emf in the loop when _t_ = 3 s?

(ii) As time passes, the magnetic flux linked with the loop increases. According to Lenz’s law, the direction of the induced current should be in a way so as to oppose the flux increase. So, the induced current flows in such a way to produce a magnetic field opposite to the given field. This magnetic field is perpendicularly outwards. Therefore, the induced current flows in anti- clockwise direction.

### Motional emf from Lorentz force

Consider a straight conducting rod _AB_ of length _l_ in a uniform magnetic field 

_B_ which is directed perpendicularly into the plane of the paper as shown in Figure 4.9(a). The length of the rod is normal to the magnetic field. Let the rod move with a constant velocity _v_



towards right side. When the rod moves, the free electrons

present in it also move with same velocity _v_ 

in 

B. As a result, the Lorentz force acts on free electrons in the direction from B to A and is given by the relation

_F e BB_

   =− ×( )_v_ (4.4)

The action of this Lorentz force is to accumulate the free electrons at the end _A_. This accumulation of free electrons produces a potential difference across the rod which in turn establishes an electric field 

E directed along _BA_ (Figure 4.9(b)). Due to the electric field



_E_, the coulomb force starts acting on the free electrons along _AB_ and is given by

_F eEE_

    (4.5)

The magnitude of the electric field 

E keeps on increasing as long as accumulation of electrons at the end _A_ continues. The force _FE_ also increases until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, the magnetic Lorentz force



_FB_ and the coulomb force 

_FE_ balance each other and no further accumulation of free electrons at the end _A_ takes place. i.e.,

_F FB E_\=

_vB E_sin 90

_vB E_\= (4.6)

The potential difference between two ends of the rod is

_V El_\=

_V Bl_\=_v_

Thus the Lorentz force on the free electrons is responsible to maintain this potential difference and hence produces an emf

ε = _Blv_ (4.7)

As this emf is produced due to the movement of the rod, it is often called as **motional emf**. If the ends A and B are connected by an external circuit of total

resistance _R_, then current _i R_

_Bl R_

Even for a conductor in the form of a sheet or plate, an emf is induced when magnetic flux linked with it changes. But the difference is that there is no definite loop or path for induced current to flow away. As a result, the induced currents flow in concentric circular paths (Figure 4.10). As these electric currents resemble eddies of water, these are known as **Eddy currents**. They are also called **Foucault currents**.

**Demonstration** Here is a simple demonstration

for the production of eddy currents. Consider a pendulum that can be made to oscillate between the poles of a powerful electromagnet (Figure 4.11(a)).

First the electromagnet is switched off, the pendulum is slightly displaced and released. It begins to oscillate and it executes a large number of oscillations before stopping. The air friction is the only damping force.

When the electromagnet is switched on and the disc of the pendulum is made to oscillate, eddy currents are produced in it which will

**(a) (b)**

**S**

![Demonstration of eddy currents  ](4.11.png "")

oppose the oscillation. A heavy damping force of eddy currents will bring the pendulum to rest within a few oscillations (Figure 4.11(b)).

However if some slots are cut in the disc (Figure 4.11(c)), the eddy currents are reduced. The pendulum now will execute several oscillations before coming to rest. This clearly demonstrates the production of eddy current in the disc of the pendulum.

**Drawbacks of Eddy currents** When eddy currents flow in the

conductor, a large amount of energy is dissipated in the form of heat. The energy loss due to the flow of eddy current is inevitable but it can be reduced to a greater extent with suitable measures.

The design of transformer core and electric motor armature is crucial in order to minimise the eddy current loss. To reduce these losses, the core of the transformer is made up of thin laminas insulated from one another (Figure 4.12 (a)) while for electric motor the winding is made up of a group

**Figure 4.12 (b)** Insulated winding of an electric motor

of wires insulated from one another (Figure 4.12 (b)). The insulation used does not allow huge eddy currents to flow and hence losses are minimized.

**Example** A spherical stone and a spherical

metallic ball of same size and mass are dropped from the same height. Which one, a stone or a metal ball, will reach the Earth’s surface first? Justify your answer. Assume that there is no air friction. **Answer**

The stone will reach the Earth’s surface earlier than the metal ball. The reason is that when the metal ball falls through the magnetic field of Earth, the eddy currents are produced in it which opposes its motion. But in the case of stone, no eddy currents are produced and it falls freely.  

N S N S

Slow damping Rapid damping

**Glass Metal**

Make a pendulum with a strong magnet suspended at the lower end of the suspension wire as shown in the first figure. Make it oscillate with a glass plate below it and note the time it takes to come to rest.

Next just place a metallic plate below the oscillating magnet as shown in the second figure and again note the time it takes to stop.

In the second case, the magnet stops soon because eddy currents are produced in the plate which opposes the oscillation of the magnet.

**Activity**

**Application of eddy currents** Though the production of eddy current

is undesirable in some cases, it is useful in some other cases. A few of them are i. Induction stove ii. Eddy current brake iii. Eddy current testing iv. Electromagnetic damping

**i. Induction stove** Induction stove is used to cook the

food quickly and safely with less energy consumption. Below the cooking zone, there is a tightly wound coil of insulated wire. The cooking pan made of suitable material, is placed over the cooking zone. When the stove is switched on, an alternating current flowing in the coil produces high frequency alternating magnetic field which induces very strong eddy

currents in the cooking pan. The eddy currents in the pan produce so much of heat due to Joule heating which is used to cook the food (Figure 4.13).

**Note:** The frequency of the domestic AC supply is increased from 50–60 Hz to around 20–40 KHz before giving it to the coil in order to produce high frequency alternating magnetic field.

**ii. Eddy current brake** This eddy current braking system is

generally used in high speed trains and roller coasters. Strong electromagnets are fixed just above the rails. To stop the train, electromagnets are switched on. The magnetic field of these magnets induces eddy currents in the rails which oppose or resist the movement of the train. This is Eddy current linear brake (Figure 4.14(a)).

In some cases, the circular disc, connected to the wheel of the train through a common shaft, is made to rotate in between the poles of an electromagnet. When there is a relative motion between the disc and the magnet, eddy currents are induced in the disc which stop the train. This is Eddy current circular brake (Figure 4.14(b))

The armature of the galvanometer coil is wound on a soft iron cylinder. Once the armature is deflected, the relative motion between the soft iron cylinder and the radial magnetic field induces eddy current in the cylinder (Figure 4.16). The damping force due to the flow of eddy current brings

## SELF–INDUCTION

### Introduction

Inductor is a device used to store energy in a magnetic field when an electric current flows through it. The typical examples are coils, solenoids and toroids shown in Figure 4.17.

Inductance is the property of inductors to generate emf due to the change in current flowing through that circuit (self- induction) or a change in current through a neighbouring circuit with which it is magnetically linked (mutual induction). We will study about self-induction and mutual induction in the next sections.

Coil

Solenoid

Toroid

![Examples for inductor](4.17.png "")

**Self-induction** An electric current flowing through a

coil will set up a magnetic field around it. Therefore, the magnetic flux of the magnetic field is linked with that coil itself. If this flux






| Ed dy |
|------|------|------|------|------|

is changed by changing the current, an emf is induced in that same coil (Figure 4.18). This phenomenon is known as **self-induction**. The emf induced is called self-induced emf.

_i_

B →

![Self-Induction](4.18.png "")

Let Φ_B_ be the magnetic flux linked with each turn of the coil of N turns, then the total flux linked with the coil _N B_Φ (flux linkage) is proportional to the current _i_ in the coil.

_N iB_Φ µ

_N LiB_Φ = (4.8)

(or) _L N i_

_B_\= Φ

The constant of proportionality _L_ is called self-inductance or coefficient of self- induction of the coil.

If _i_ \=1A , then _L N B_\= Φ . **Self-inductance or simply inductance of a coil is defined as the flux linkage with the coil when 1A current flows through it.**

When the current _i_ changes with time, an emf is induced in it. From Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, this self- induced emf in the coil is given by

=−

_d Li dt_

_B_( )

(using equation 4.8)  

∴ =−ε _L di dt_

(4.9)

(or) _L di_

_dt_ \= −ε

The negative sign in the above equation implies that the self-induced emf always opposes the change in current with respect to time. If _di_

_dt_ \= −1 1 As , then _L_\=−ε .

**Inductance of a coil is also defined as the opposing emf induced in the coil when the rate of change of current through the coil is 1 A s−1.**

**Unit of inductance** Inductance is a scalar and its unit is

Wb A-1 or Vs A-1 . It is also measured in henry (H).

1 1 11 1 H W b A Vs A= =− −

The dimensional formula of inductance is _M L T A_ 2 2 2- - .

If _i_ = 1 A and _N B_Φ =1 Wb turns, then _L_ \=1H .

Therefore, **the inductance of the coil is said to be one henry if a current of 1 _A_ produces unit flux linkage in the coil.**

If _di dt_ \=

−1 1As and ε=−1 V , then _L_ \=1H.

Therefore, **the inductance of the coil is one henry if a current changing at the rate of 1 A s−1 induces an opposing emf of 1 V in it.**

**Physical significance of inductance** We have learnt about inertia in XI

standard. In translational motion, mass is a measure of linear inertia; in the same way, for rotational motion, moment of inertia is a measure of rotational inertia (Refer sections 3.2.1 and 5.4 of XI physics text book). Generally, inertia means opposition to change its state.




  

_i_

ε(a)

**Increasing current**

_i_

ε(b)

**Decreasing current**

![Induced emf ε opposes the changing current _i_](4.19.png "")

The inductance plays the same role in a circuit as mass and moment of inertia play in mechanical motion. When a circuit is switched on, the increasing current induces an emf which opposes the growth of current in a circuit (Figure 4.19(a)). Likewise, when circuit is broken, the decreasing current induces an emf in the reverse direction. This emf now opposes the decay of current (Figure 4.19(b)).

Thus, inductance of the coil opposes any change in current and tries to maintain the original state.

### Self-inductance of a long solenoid

Consider a long solenoid of length _l_ and cross-sectional area _A_. Let _n_ be the number of turns per unit length (or turn density) of the solenoid. When an electric current _i_ is passed through the solenoid, a magnetic  

field produced inside is almost uniform and is directed along the axis of the solenoid as shown in Figure 4.20. The magnetic field at any point inside the solenoid is given by (Refer section 3.9.3)

_B ni_\= µ 

As this magnetic field passes through the solenoid, the windings of the solenoid are linked by the field lines. The magnetic flux passing through each turn is

Comparing the above equations, we get

From the above equation, it is clear that inductance depends on the geometry of the solenoid (turn density _n_, cross-sectional area _A_, length _l_) and the medium present inside the solenoid. If the solenoid is filled with a dielectric medium of relative permeability µ_r_ , then

**Energy stored in an inductor** Whenever a current is established in the

circuit, the inductance opposes the growth of the current. In order to establish a current in the circuit, work is done against this opposition by some external agency. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy.

Let us assume that electrical resistance of the inductor is negligible and inductor effect alone is considered. The induced emf ε at any instant _t_ is

ε=−_L di dt_

Let _dW_ be work done in moving a charge _dq_ in a time _dt_ against the opposition, then

### Mutual induction

When an electric current passing through a coil changes with time, an emf is induced in the neighbouring coil. This phenomenon is known as **mutual induction** and the emf induced is called mutually induced emf.

Consider two coils which are placed close to each other. If an electric current _i_1 is sent through coil 1, the magnetic field produced by it is also linked with coil 2 as shown in Figure 4.21(a).

If Φ21 is the magnetic flux linked with each turn of the coil 2 of _N_2 turns due to the current in coil 1, then the total flux linked with coil 2 ( )_N_2 21Φ is proportional to the current _i_1 in the coil 1.

The constant of proportionality _M_21

is the mutual inductance or coefficient of mutual induction of the coil 2 with respect to coil 1.

If _i A_1 1= , then _M N_21 2 21 = Φ . Therefore, **the** **mutual inductance _M_21 is defined as the flux linkage with the coil 2 when 1A current flows through coil 1.**

When the current _i_1 changes with time, an emf ε2 is induced in coil 2. From Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, this mutually induced emf ε2 is given by

The negative sign in the above equation shows that the mutually induced emf always opposes the change in current _i_1 with respect

to time. If _di dt_

1 11= −A s , then _M_21 2=−ε . **Mutual inductance _M_21 is also defined as the opposing emf induced in the coil 2 when the rate of change of current through the coil 1 is 1As–1.**

Similarly, if an electric current _i_2 through coil 2 changes with time, then emf ε1 is induced in coil 1. Therefore,

where _M_12 is the mutual inductance of the coil 1 with respect to coil 2. It can be shown that for a given pair of coils, the mutual inductance is same. i.e.,

_M M M_21 12= =

In general, the mutual induction between two coils depends on size, shape, the number of turns of the coils, their relative orientation and permeability of the medium.

**Unit of mutual-inductance** The unit of mutual inductance is also

henry (H).

If _i_1 1= A and _N_2 21 1Φ = Wb turns, then _M_ \=1H .

Therefore, **the mutual inductance between two neighbouring coils is said to be one henry if a current of 1A in one coil produces unit flux linkage in neighbouring coil.**  

If _di dt_

1 11= −As and ε2 1=− V , then

_M_ \=1H.

Therefore, **the mutual inductance between two neighbouring coils is one henry if a current changing at the rate of 1A s–1 in one coil induces an opposing emf of 1V in neighbouring coil.**

### Mutual inductance between two long co-axial solenoids

Consider two long co-axial solenoids of same length _l_. The length of these solenoids is large when compared to their radii so that the magnetic field produced inside the solenoids is uniform and the fringing effect at the ends may be ignored. Let _A_1 and _A_2 be the area of cross section of the solenoids with _A_1 being greater than _A_2 as shown in Figure 4.22. The turn density of these solenoids are _n_1 and _n_2 respectively.

## METHODS OF PRODUCING INDUCED EMF

### Introduction

Electromotive force is the characteristic of any energy source capable of driving electric charge around a circuit. We have already learnt that it is not actually a force. It is the work done in moving unit electric charge around the circuit. It is measured in J C–1 or volt.

Some examples of energy source which provide emf are electrochemical cells, thermoelectric devices, solar cells and electrical generators. Of these, electrical

generators are most powerful machines. They are used for large scale power generation.

According to Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction, an emf is induced in a circuit when magnetic flux linked with it changes. This emf is called induced emf. The magnitude of the induced emf is given by

ε = _d dt_

_orB_Φ

ε θ= _d dt_

_BA_( cos ) (4.17)

From the above equation, it is clear that induced emf can be produced by changing magnetic flux in any of the following ways. (i) By changing the magnetic field _B_ (ii) By changing the area _A_ of the coil

and (iii) By changing the relative orientation

θ of the coil with magnetic field

### Production of induced emf by changing the magnetic field

From Faraday’s experiments on electromagnetic induction, it was discovered that an emf is induced in a circuit by changing the magnetic flux of the field through it. The change in flux is brought about by (i) relative motion between the circuit and the magnet (First experiment) (ii) variation in current flowing through the nearby coil (Second experiment).

### Production of induced emf by changing the area of the coil

Consider a conducting rod of length _l_ moving with a velocity _υ_ towards left on a rectangular fixed metallic framework as shown in Figure 4.23. The whole  

arrangement is placed in a uniform magnetic field



_B_ whose magnetic lines are perpendicularly directed into the plane of the paper.

As the rod moves from _AB_ to _DC_ in a time _dt_, the area enclosed by the loop and hence the magnetic flux through the loop decreases.

As a result of change in flux, an emf is generated in the loop. The magnitude of the induced emf is

ε = _d dt_

_B_Φ

ε = _Blv_ (4.18)

This emf is known as **motional emf** since it is produced due to the movement of the conductor in the magnetic field. The direction of induced current is found to be clockwise from Fleming’s right hand rule.

**EXAMPLE 4.14**

A circular metal of area 0.03 m2 rotates in a uniform magnetic field of 0.4 T. The axis of rotation passes through the centre and perpendicular to its plane and is also parallel to the field. If the disc completes 20 revolutions in one second and the resistance of the disc is 4 Ω, calculate the induced emf between the axis and the rim and induced current flowing in the disc.

**_Solution_**

### Production of induced emf by changing relative orientation of the coil with the magnetic field

Consider a rectangular coil of _N_ turns kept in a uniform magnetic field



_B_ as shown in Figure 4.24. The coil rotates in anti- clockwise direction with an angular velocity _ω_ about an axis, perpendicular to the field and to the plane of the paper.

At time _t_ = 0, the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the field and the flux linked with the coil has its maximum value Фm = _NBA_ (where _A_ is the area of the coil).

In a time _t_ seconds, the coil is rotated through an angle θ (= _ωt_) in anti–clockwise direction. In this position, the flux linked _NBAcosωt_ is due to the component of



_B_ normal to the plane of the coil. The component (_B sinωt_) parallel to the plane has no role in electromagnetic induction. Therefore, the flux linkage with the coil at this deflected position is

When the coil is rotated through 90o from initial position, sin _ωt_ = 1. Then the maximum value of induced emf is

 _m NBA_\=

Therefore, the value of induced emf at any instant is then given by

ε ε ω= _m t_sin (4.22)

It is seen that the induced emf varies as sine function of the time angle _ωt_. The graph between induced emf and time angle for one rotation of the coil will be a sine curve (Figure 4.25) and the emf varying in this manner is called **sinusoidal emf** or **alternating emf**.

If this alternating voltage is given to a closed circuit, a sinusoidally varying current flows in it. This current is called **alternating current** and is given by

_i I tm_\= sinω (4.23)

where _Im_ is the maximum value of induced current.  

**EXAMPLE 4.15**

A rectangular coil of area 70 cm2 having 600 turns rotates about an axis perpendicular to a magnetic field of 0.4 Wb m–2. If the coil completes 500 revolutions in a minute, calculate the instantaneous emf when the plane of the coil is (i) perpendicular to the field (ii) parallel to the field and (iii) inclined at 60o with the field.

## AC GENERATOR

### Introduction

AC generator or alternator is an energy conversion device. It converts mechanical energy used to rotate the coil or field magnet into electrical energy. Alternator produces a large scale electrical power for use in homes and industries. AC generator and its components are shown in Figure 4.26.

**Alternator**

**Stator**

**Slip rings**

**Rotor**

![AC generator and its components](4.26.png "")

### Principle

Alternators work on the principle of electromagnetic induction. The relative motion between a conductor and a magnetic field changes the magnetic flux linked with  

the conductor which in turn, induces an emf. The magnitude of the induced emf is given by Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and its direction by Fleming’s right hand rule.

Alternating emf is generated by rotating a coil in a magnetic field or by rotating

a magnetic field within a stationary coil. The first method is used for small AC generators while the second method is employed for large AC generators. The rotating-field method is the one which is mostly used in power stations.

**Note**

### Construction

Alternator consists of two major parts, namely stator and rotor. As their names suggest, stator is stationary while rotor rotates inside the stator. In any standard construction of commercial alternators, the armature winding is mounted on stator and the field magnet on rotor. **i) Stator**

The stationary part which has armature windings mounted in it is called stator. It has two components, namely stator core and armature winding.

Stator core or armature core is made up of iron or steel alloy. It is a hollow cylinder and is laminated to minimize eddy current loss. The slots are cut on inner surface of the core to accommodate armature windings.

Armature winding is the coil, wound on slots provided in the armature core (Figure 4.27).

**ii) Rotor**

Rotor contains magnetic field windings. The magnetic poles are magnetized by




  

DC source. The ends of field windings are connected to a pair of slip rings, attached to a common shaft about which rotor rotates. Slip rings rotate along with rotor. To maintain connection between the DC source and field windings, two brushes are used which continuously slide over the slip rings. The 2-pole rotor is shown in Figure 4.27.

We will discuss the construction and working of two examples, namely single phase and three phase AC generators in the following sections.

### Advantages of stationary armature-rotating field alternator

Alternators are generally high current and high voltage machines. The stationary armature-rotating field construction has many advantages. A few of them include: 1) The current is drawn directly from fixed

terminals on the stator without the use of brush contacts.

2) The insulation of stationary armature winding is easier.

3) The number of sliding contacts (slip rings) is reduced. Moreover, the sliding contacts are used for low-voltage DC Source.

4) Armature windings can be constructed more rigidly to prevent deformation due to any mechanical stress.

### Single phase AC generator

In a single phase AC generator, the armature conductors are connected in series so as to form a single circuit which generates a single-phase alternating emf and hence it is called single-phase alternator.

In the simplified version of AC generator, a single-turn rectangular loop PQRS is mounted on the stator. The field winding is fixed inside the stator and it can be rotated about an axis, perpendicular to the plane of the paper.

The loop PQRS is stationary and is also perpendicular to the plane of the paper. When field windings are excited, magnetic field is produced around it. Let the field magnet be rotated in clockwise direction by some external means (Figure 4.28).

|------|

  

Assume that initial position of the field magnet is horizontal. At that instant, the direction of magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane of the loop PQRS. The induced emf is zero (Refer case (iii) of section 4.4). This is represented by origin O in the graph drawn between induced emf and time angle (Figure 4.29).

When field magnet rotates through 90°, magnetic field becomes parallel to PQRS. The induced emfs across PQ and RS would become maximum. Since they are connected in series, emfs are added up and the direction of total induced emf is given by Fleming’s right hand rule.

Care has to be taken while applying this rule; the thumb indicates the direction of the motion of the conductor with respect to field. For clockwise rotating poles, the conductor appears to be rotating anticlockwise. Hence, thumb should point to the left. The direction

![Variation of induced emf with re  ](4.29.png "")

of the induced emf is at right angles to the plane of the paper. For PQ, it is inwards and for RS it is outwards. Therefore, the current flows along PQRS. The point A in the graph represents this maximum emf.

For the rotation of 180° from the initial position, the field is again perpendicular to PQRS and the induced emf becomes zero. This is represented by point B.

The field magnet becomes again parallel to PQRS for 270° rotation of field magnet. The induced emf is maximum but the direction is reversed. Thus the current flows along SRQP. This is represented by point C.

On completion of 360°, the induced emf becomes zero and is represented by the point D. From the graph, it is clear that emf induced in PQRS is alternating in nature. Therefore, when field magnet completes one rotation, induced emf in PQRS finishes one cycle.

### Poly-phase AC generator

Some AC generators may have more than one coil in the armature core and each coil produces an alternating emf. In these generators, more than one emf is produced. Thus they are called **poly-phase generators**.

If there are two alternating emfs produced in a generator, it is called two- phase generator. In some AC generators, there are three separate coils, which would give three separate emfs. Hence they are called **three-phase AC generators**.

### Three-phase AC generator

In the simplified construction of three- phase AC generator, the armature core has 6 slots, cut on its inner rim. Each slot is 60° away from one another. Six armature conductors are mounted in these slots. The conductors 1 and 4 are joined in series to form coil 1. The conductors 3 and 6 form coil 2 while the conductors 5 and 2 form coil 3. So, these coils are retangular in shape and are 120° apart from one another (Figure 4.30).

**Initial position**  

The initial position of the field magnet is horizontal and field direction is perpendicular to the plane of the coil 1. As it is seen in single phase AC generator, when field magnet is rotated from that position in clockwise direction, alternating emf ε1 in coil 1 begins a cycle from origin O. This is shown in Figure 4.31.

The corresponding cycle for alternating emf ε2 in coil 2 starts at point A after field magnet has rotated through 120°. Therefore, the phase difference between ε1 and ε2 is 120°. Similarly, emf ε3 in coil 3 would begin its cycle at point B after 240° rotation of field magnet from initial position. Thus these emfs produced in the three phase AC generator have 120° phase difference between one another.

1) For a given dimension of the generator, three-phase machine produces higher power output than a single-phase machine.

2) For the same capacity, three-phase alternator is smaller in size when compared to single-phase alternator.

3) Three-phase transmission system is cheaper. A relatively thinner wire is sufficient for transmission of three- phase power.

## TRANSFORMER

**Transformer is a stationary device used to transform electrical power from one circuit to another without changing its frequency**. The applied alternating voltage is either increased or decreased with corresponding decrease or increase of current in the circuit.

If the transformer converts an alternating current with low voltage into an alternating current with high voltage, it is called **step-up transformer**. On the contrary, if the transformer converts alternating current with high voltage into an alternating current with low voltage, then it is called **step-down transformer**.

### Construction and working of transformer

**Principle** The principle of transformer is the

mutual induction between two coils. That is, when an electric current passing through a coil changes with time, an emf is induced in the neighbouring coil. **Construction**

In the simple construction of transformers, there are two coils of high mutual inductance wound over the same transformer core. The core is generally  

laminated and is made up of a good magnetic material like silicon steel. Coils are electrically insulated but magnetically linked via transformer core (Figure 4.32).

The coil across which alternating voltage is applied is called primary coil _P_ and the coil from which output power is drawn out is called secondary coil _S_. The assembled core and coils are kept in a container which is filled with suitable medium for better insulation and cooling purpose.

**Working** If the primary coil is connected to a

source of alternating voltage, an alternating magnetic flux is set up in the laminated core. If there is no magnetic flux leakage, then whole of magnetic flux linked with primary coil is also linked with secondary

coil. This means that rate at which magnetic flux changes through each turn is same for both primary and secondary coils.

As a result of flux change, emf is induced in both primary and secondary coils. The emf induced in the primary coil or back emf εp is given by

But the voltage applied _vp_ across the primary is equal to the back emf. Then

_v N d dtp p_

_B_\=− Φ (4.24)

The frequency of alternating magnetic flux in the core is same as the frequency of the applied voltage. Therefore, induced emf in secondary will also have same frequency as that of applied voltage. The emf induced in the secondary coil εs is given by

**Efficiency of a transformer: The efficiency η of a transformer is**

**defined as the ratio of the useful output power to the input power**. Thus

η= × Output power Input power

100% (4.28)

Transformers are highly efficient devices having their efficiency in the range of 96 – 99%. Various energy losses in transformers will not allow them to be 100% efficient.

### Energy losses in a transformer

Transformers do not have any moving parts so that its efficiency is much higher than that of rotating machines like generators and motors. But there are many factors which lead to energy loss in a transformer. **i) Core loss or Iron loss**

This loss takes place in transformer core. Hysteresis loss (Refer section 3.6) and eddy current loss are known as core loss or Iron loss. When transformer core is magnetized and demagnetized repeatedly by the alternating voltage applied across primary coil, hysteresis takes place due to




  

which some energy is lost in the form of heat. Hysteresis loss is minimized by using steel of high silicon content in making transformer core. Alternating magnetic flux in the core induces eddy currents in it. Therefore there is energy loss due to the flow of eddy current, called eddy current loss which is minimized by using very thin laminations of transformer core.

**ii) Copper loss** Transformer windings have electrical resistance. When an electric current flows through them, some amount of energy is dissipated due to Joule heating. This energy loss is called copper loss which is minimized by using wires of larger diameter.

**iii) Flux leakage** Flux leakage happens when the magnetic lines of primary coil are not completely linked with secondary coil. Energy loss due to this flux leakage is minimized by winding coils one over the other.

### Advantages of AC in long distance power transmission

Electric power is produced in a large scale at electric power stations with the help of AC generators. These power stations are classified based on the type of fuel used as thermal, hydro electric and nuclear power stations. Most of these stations are located at remote places. Hence the electric power generated is transmitted over long distances through transmission lines to reach towns or cities where it is actually consumed. This process is called **power transmission**.

But there is a difficulty during power transmission. A sizable fraction of electric  

power is lost due to Joule heating (_i R_2 ) in the transmission lines which are hundreds of kilometer long. This power loss can be tackled either by reducing current _I_ or by reducing resistance _R_ of the transmission lines. The resistance _R_ can be reduced with thick wires of copper or aluminium. But this increases the cost of production of transmission lines and other related expenses. So this way of reducing power loss is not economically viable.

![Long distance power transmissions](4.33.png "")

Since power produced is alternating in nature, there is a way out. The most important property of alternating voltage that it can be stepped up and stepped down by using transformers could be exploited in reducing current and thereby reducing power losses to a greater extent.

At the transmitting point, the voltage is increased and the corresponding current is decreased by using step-up transformer (Figure 4.33). Then it is transmitted through transmission lines. This reduced current at high voltage reaches the destination without any appreciable loss. At the receiving point, the voltage is decreased and the current is increased to appropriate values by using step-down transformer and then it is given to consumers. Thus power transmission is done efficiently and economically.




  

**Illustration:** An electric power of 2 MW is transmitted to a place through transmission lines of total resistance _R_ = 40 Ω, at two different voltages. One is lower voltage (10 kV) and the other is higher (100 kV). Let us now calculate and compare power losses in these two cases.

Thus it is clear that when an electric power is transmitted at higher voltage, the power loss is reduced to a large extent.

**Power system at a glance**

The generating stations present in a region ar network and are operated in parallel. This is to number of consumers in the case of failure of a beyond the capacity of the generating station.

The various elements such as generating sta distributors etc are all tied together for continu energy.This is called power system. A part of po transmission lines is known as a grid.

In a power system, the transfer of electric po in two stages which are further sub-divided int

1) Transmission stage a) Primary transmission stage b) Secondary transmission stage 2) Distribution stage a) Primary distribution stage b) Secondary transmission stage

and then it is supplied to individual consumers. These two stages of power transmission is presented in a single- line diagram shown in figure. The central system usually generates power at 11 kV which is stepped up to 132 kV and is transmitted through transmission lines. This is known as primary or high- voltage transmission.

This high-voltage power reaches receiving station at the outskirts of the city where it is stepped down to 33 kV and is transmitted as secondary or low- voltage transmission to sub-stations situated within the city limits.

In the primary distribution system, the voltage is reduced from 33 kV to 3.3kV at sub-stations and is given to distribution sub-stations. The voltage is finally brought down to 440V or 230V at distribution sub-station from where secondary homes (230V) via distribution networks.

## ALTERNATING CURRENT

### Introduction

In section 4.5, we have seen that when the orientation of the coil with the magnetic field is changed, an alternating emf is induced and hence an alternating current flows in the closed circuit. **An alternating voltage is the voltage which changes polarity at regular intervals of time and the direction of the resulting alternating current also changes accordingly.**

In the Figure 4.34(a), an alternating voltage source is connected to a resistor _R_ in which the upper terminal of the source

is positive and lower terminal negative at an instant. Therefore, the current flows in clockwise direction. After a short time, the polarities of the source are reversed so that current now flows in anti-clockwise direction (Figure 4.34(b)). This current which flows in alternate directions in the circuit is called alternating current.

**Sinusoidal alternating voltage If the waveform of alternating voltage is**

**a sine wave, then it is known as sinusoidal alternating voltage** which is given by the relation.

_v_ \=_V tm_ sinω (4.29)

where _υ_ is the instantaneous value of alternating voltage; _Vm_ is the maximum value (amplitude) and ω is the angular frequency of the alternating voltage. When sinusoidal alternating voltage is applied to a closed circuit, the resulting alternating current is also sinusoidal in nature and its relation is

_i I tm_\= sinω (4.30)

where _Im_ is the maximum value (amplitude) of the alternating current. The direction of sinusoidal voltage or current is reversed after every half-cycle and its magnitude is also changing continuously as shown in Figure 4.35.

Interestingly, sine waves are very common in nature. The periodic motions like waves

in water, swinging of pendulum are associated with sine waves. Thus sine wave seems to be nature’s standard. Also refer unit 11 of XI physics text book.

**Note**

### Mean or Average value of AC

The current and voltage in a DC system remain constant over a period of time so that there is no problem in specifying their magnitudes. However, an alternating current or voltage varies from time to time. Then a question arises how to express the magnitude of an alternating current or voltage. Though there are many ways of expressing it, we limit our discussion with two ways, namely mean value and RMS (Root Mean Square) value of AC.

**Mean or Average value of AC** We have learnt that the magnitude of

an alternating current in a circuit changes from one instant to other instant and its direction also reverses for every half cycle. During positive half cycle, current is taken as positive and during negative cycle it is negative. Therefore mean or average value of symmetrical alternating current over one complete cycle is zero.

Therefore the average or mean value is measured over one half of a cycle. These electrical terms, average current and average voltage, can be used in both AC and DC circuit analysis and calculations.

**The average value of alternating current is defined as the average of all values of current over a positive half-cycle or a negative half-cycle.**  

The instantaneous value of sinusoidal alternating current is given by the equation _i I i Im m_\= =sin t or sinω θ (where θ = _ωt_) whose graphical representation is given in Figure 4.36.

The sum of all currents over a half-cycle is given by area of positive half-cycle (or negative half-cycle). Therefore,

### RMS value of AC

The term RMS refers to time-varying sinusoidal currents and voltages which is not used in DC systems.

**The root mean square value of an alternating current is defined as the square root of the mean of the squares of all currents over one cycle.** It is denoted by _IRMS_ . For alternating voltages, the RMS value is given by _VRMS_ .

The alternating current _i Im_\= sin t orω or _i I i Im m_\= =sin t or sinω θ, is represented graphically in Figure 4.37. The corresponding squared current wave is also shown by the dotted lines.

The sum of the squares of all currents over one cycle is given by the area of one cycle of squared wave. Therefore,

Thus we find that for a symmetrical sinusoidal current rms value of current is 70.7 % of its peak value.

_V Vrms m_\= 0 707. (4.36)

RMS value of alternating current is also called effective value and is

represented as _Ieff_. It is used to compare RMS current of AC to an equivalent steady current. **RMS value is also defined as that value of the steady current which when flowing through a given circuit for a given time produces the same amount of heat as produced by the alternating current when flowing through the same circuit for the same time.** The effective value of an alternating voltage is represented by _Veff_.

**A sinusoidal alternating voltage (or current) can be represented by a vector which rotates about the origin in anti-clockwise direction at a constant angular velocity ω. Such a rotating vector is called a** **phasor**. A phasor is drawn in such a way that

·   the length of the line segment equals the peak value _Vm_ (or _Im_) of the alternating voltage (or current)

·   its angular velocity ω is equal to the angular frequency of the alternating voltage (or current)

·   the projection of phasor on any vertical axis gives the instantaneous value of the alternating voltage (or current)  

·   the angle between the phasor and the axis of reference (positive x-axis) indicates the phase of the alternating voltage (or current). The notion of phasors is introduced to

analyse phase relationship between voltage and current in different AC circuits.

**Phasor diagram**

**The diagram which shows various phasors and their phase relations is called phasor diagram**. Consider a sinusoidal alternating voltage _v_ = _Vm_ sin ωt applied to a circuit. This voltage can be represented by a phasor, namely _OA_

offered by the inductor, called inductive reactance (_XL_). It is measured in ohm.

_X LL_ \=ω

**An inductor blocks AC but it allows DC. Why? and How?**

An inductor _L_ is a closely wound helical coil. The steady DC current flowing through _L_ produces uniform magnetic field around it and the magnetic flux linked remains constant. Therefore there is no self-induction and self-induced emf (back emf). Since inductor behaves like a resistor, DC flows through an inductor.

The AC flowing through _L_ produces time-varying magnetic field which in turn induces self-induced emf (back emf). This back emf, according to Lenz’s law, opposes any change in the current. Since AC varies both in magnitude and direction, its flow is opposed in _L_. For an ideal inductor of zero ohmic resistance, the back emf is equal and opposite to the applied emf. Therefore _L_ blocks AC.

The inductive reactance (_XL_) varies directly as the frequency.

_X f LL_ \= 2π (4.42)

where _f_ is the frequency of the alternating current. For a steady current, _f_ = 0. Therefore, _XL_ = 0. Thus an ideal inductor offers no resistance to steady DC current.

### AC circuit containing only a capacitor

Consider a circuit containing a capacitor of capacitance _C_ connected across an alternating voltage source (Figure 4.44). The instantaneous value of the alternating voltage is given by

Thus a capacitive circuit offers infinite resistance to the steady current. So that steady current cannot flow through the capacitor.

### AC circuit containing a resistor, an inductor and a capacitor in series – Series RLC circuit

Consider a circuit containing a resistor of resistance _R_, an inductor of inductance _L_ and a capacitor of capacitance _C_ connected across an alternating voltage source (Figure 4.46). The instantaneous value of the alternating voltage is given by

![AC circuit containing _R_, _L_ and _C_  ](4.46.png "")

Let _i_ be the resulting current in the circuit at that instant. As a result, the voltage is developed across _R_, _L_ and _C_.

We know that voltage across _R_ (_V_R) is in phase with _i_, voltage across _L_ (_VL_) leads _i_ by π/2 and voltage across _C_ (_VC_) lags behind _i_ by π/2.

The phasor diagram is drawn with current as the reference phasor. The current is represented by the phasor _OI V OA V OB V OCR L C_

The length of these phasors are

_OI_ = _Im_, _OA_ = _ImR_, _OB_ = _ImXL_; _OC_ = _ImXC_

The circuit is either effectively inductive or capacitive or resistive depending on the value of _VL_ or _VC_. Let us assume that _VL _\> _VC_. Therefore, net voltage drop across _L_\-_C_ combination is _VL_ – _VC_ which is represented by a phasor _OD_

  .

By parallelogram law, the diagonal _OE_  

gives the resultant voltage _v_ of _VR_ and (_VL_ – _VC_) and its length _OE_ is equal to _Vm_. Therefore,

![Voltage and impedance triangle when _XL_ > _XC_](4.48.png "")


The voltage triangle and impedance triangle are given in the Figure 4.48.

From phasor diagram, the phase angle between _v_ and _i_ is found out from the following relation

**Special cases** (i) If _XL_ > _XC_, (_XL_−_XC_) is positive and phase

∴ = = −( )_v V t i I tm m_sin ; sinω ω φ

(ii) If _XL_ < _XC_, (_XL_ − _XC_) is negative and ϕ is also negative. Therefore current leads voltage by ϕ and the circuit is capacitive.

(iii) If _XL_ = _XC_, ϕ is zero. Therefore current and voltage are in the same phase and the circuit is resistive.

### Resonance in series RLC Circuit

When the frequency of the applied alternating source ω_r_( ) is equal to the

natural frequency 

circuit, the current in the circuit reaches its maximum value. Then the circuit is said to be in **electrical resonance**. The frequency at which resonance takes place is called **resonant frequency**.

(4.49)

This is the condition for resonance in RLC circuit.

Since _XL_ and _XC_ are frequency dependent, the resonance condition _X XL C_\=( ) can be achieved by varying the frequency of the applied voltage.

**Effects of series resonance** When series resonance occurs, the

impedance of the circuit is minimum and is equal to the resistance of the circuit. As a result of this, the current in the circuit becomes maximum. This is shown in the resonance curve drawn between current and frequency (Figure 4.49).

At resonance, the impedance is

Therefore, the current in the circuit is

_m_\= _R_

(4.51)

The maximum current at series resonance is limited by the resistance of the circuit. For smaller resistance, larger current with sharper curve is obtained and vice versa.

**Applications of series RLC resonant circuit**

RLC circuits have many applications like filter circuits, oscillators, voltage multipliers etc. An important use of series RLC resonant circuits is in the tuning circuits of radio and TV systems. The signals from many broadcasting stations at different frequencies are available in the air. To receive the signal of a particular station, tuning is done.

The tuning is commonly achieved by varying capacitance of a parallel plate variable capacitor, thereby changing the resonant frequency of the circuit. When resonant frequency is nearly equal to the frequency of the signal of the particular station, the amplitude of the current in the circuit is maximum. Thus the signal of that station alone is received.

The phenomenon of electrical resonance is possible when the circuit contains both _L_

and _C_. Only then the voltage across _L_ and _C_ cancel one another when _VL_ and _VC_ are 180° out of phase and the circuit becomes purely resistive. This implies that resonance will not occur in _RL_ and _RC_ circuits.

### Quality factor or Q–factor

The current in the series _RLC_ circuit becomes maximum at resonance. Due to the increase in current, the voltage across _L_ and _C_ are also increased. This magnification of voltages at series resonance is termed as Q–factor.

**It is defined as the ratio of voltage across _L_ or _C_ at resonance to the applied voltage**.

Q-factor =

Voltage across LorC at resonance Applied voltage

At resonance, the circuit is purely resistive. Therefore, the applied voltage is equal to the voltage across _R_.

Q-factor = 1 _R_

(4.53)

The physical meaning is that Q–factor indicates the number of times the voltage across _L_ or _C_ is greater than the applied voltage at resonance.

## POWER IN AC CIRCUITS

### Introduction of power in AC circuits

**Power of a circuit is defined as the rate of consumption of electric energy in that circuit.** It is given by the product of the voltage and current. In an AC circuit, the voltage and current vary continuously with time. Let us first calculate the power at an instant and then it is averaged over a complete cycle.

The alternating voltage and alternating current in the series inductive _RLC_ circuit at an instant are given by

_v_ \=_V tm_ sinω and _i I tm_\= +( )sin ω φ

where _ϕ_ is the phase angle between _v_ and _i_. The instantaneous power is then written as

_P_ = _v i_ \= +( )_V I t tm m_ sin sinω ω φ

\= +\[ \]_V I t t tm m_ sin sin cos cos sinω ω φ ω φ

_P V I t t tm m_\= + 

(4.54)

Here the average of sin2 ω_t_ over a cycle is 1

2 and that of sin cosω ω_t t_ is zero.

Substituting these values, we obtain average power over a cycle.

_P V Iav RMS RMS_\= cosφ (4.55)

where _V IRMS RMS_ is called apparent power and cos _ϕ_ is power factor. The average power of an AC circuit is also known as the true power of the circuit.

### Wattless current

Consider an AC circuit in which there is a phase angle of ϕ between _VRMS_ and _IRMS_ and voltage is assumed to be leading the current by ϕ as shown in the phasor diagram (Figure 4.50).

Now, _IRMS_ is resolved into two perpendicular components, namely _IRMS_ cosφ along _VRMS_ and _IRMS_ sinφ perpendicular to _VRMS_ as shown in Figure 4.51.

(i) The component of current _IRMS_ cosφ( ) which is in phase with the voltage is called active component. The power consumed by this current=_V IRMS RMS_ cosφ . So that it is also known as ‘Wattful’ current.

(ii) The other component _IRMS_ sinφ( )which has a phase angle of π

2 with the voltage is called reactive component. The power consumed is zero. Hence it is also known as ‘Wattless’ current. **The current in an AC circuit is said to**

**be wattless current if the power consumed by it is zero**. This wattless current occurs in a purely inductive or capacitive circuit.

### Power factor

Some examples for power factors: (i) Power factor = cos 0° = 1 for a pure

resistive circuit because the phase angle _ϕ_ between voltage and current is zero.

(ii) Power factor = ±( )=cos π 2 0 for a

purely inductive or capacitive circuit because the phase angle _ϕ_ between voltage and current is ±π

2 . (iii) Power factor lies between 0 and 1 for

a circuit having _R_, _L_ and _C_ in varying proportions.

### Advantages and disadvantages of AC over DC

There are many advantages and disadvantages of AC system over DC system.

**Advantages:** (i) The generation of AC is cheaper than

that of DC. (ii) When AC is supplied at higher

voltages, the transmission losses are small compared to DC transmission.

(iii) AC can easily be converted into DC with the help of rectifiers.

**Disadvantages:** (i) Alternating voltages cannot be used for

certain applications such as charging of batteries, electroplating, electric traction etc.

(ii) At high voltages, it is more dangerous to work with AC than DC.

## OSCILLATION IN LC CIRCUITS

### Energy conversion during LC oscillations

We have learnt that energy can be stored in both inductors and capacitors (Refer sections 1.8.2 and 4.3.2). In inductors, the energy is stored in the form of magnetic field while in capacitors, it is stored as the electric field.  

Whenever energy is given to a circuit containing a pure inductor of inductance _L_ and a capacitor of capacitance _C_, the energy oscillates back and forth between the magnetic field of the inductor and the electric field of the capacitor. Thus the electrical oscillations of definite frequency are generated. These oscillations are called **_LC_ oscillations**.

**Generation of LC oscillations** Let us assume that the capacitor is fully

charged with maximum charge _Qm_ at the initial stage. So that the energy stored in the capacitor is maximum and is given by

_U Q_

_CE m_\= 2

2 . As there is no current in the inductor, the energy stored in it is zero i.e., _UB_ \= 0. Therefore, the total energy is wholly electrical. This is shown in Figure 4.52(a).

The capacitor now begins to discharge through the inductor that establishes current _i_ in clockwise direction. This current produces a magnetic field around the inductor and the energy stored in

the inductor is given by _U Li B_ \=

2

2 . As

the charge in the capacitor decreases, the energy stored in it also decreases and is given by _U q_

_CE_ \= 2

2 . Thus there is a transfer of some part of energy from the capacitor to the inductor. At that instant, the total energy is the sum of electrical and magnetic energies (Figure 4.52(b)).

When the charges in the capacitor are exhausted, its energy becomes zero i.e., _UE_ \= 0 . The energy is fully transferred to the magnetic field of the inductor and its energy is maximum. This maximum energy

is given by _U LI B_

_m_\= 2

maximum current flowing in the circuit. The total energy is wholly magnetic (Figure 4.52(c)).

Even though the charge in the capacitor is zero, the current will continue to flow in the same direction because the inductor will not allow it to stop immediately. The current is made to flow with decreasing magnitude by the collapsing magnetic field of the inductor. As a result of this, the capacitor begins to charge in the opposite direction. A part of the energy is transferred from the inductor back to the capacitor. The total energy is the sum of the electrical and magnetic energies (Figure 4.52(d)).

When the current in the circuit reduces to zero, the capacitor becomes fully charged in the opposite direction. The energy stored in the capacitor becomes maximum. Since the current is zero, the energy stored in the inductor is zero. The total energy is wholly electrical (Figure 4.52(e)).

The state of the circuit is similar to the initial state but the difference is that the capacitor is charged in opposite direction. The capacitor then starts to discharge through the inductor with anti-clockwise current. The total energy is the sum of the electrical and magnetic energies (Figure 4.52(f)).

As already explained, the processes are repeated in opposite direction (Figure 4.52(g) and (h)). Finally, the circuit returns to the initial state (Figure 4.52(a)). Thus, when the circuit goes through these stages, an alternating current flows in the circuit. As this process is repeated again and again, the electrical oscillations of definite frequency are generated. These are known as _LC_ oscillations.

In the ideal _LC_ circuit, there is no loss of energy. Therefore, the oscillations will continue indefinitely. Such oscillations are called undamped oscillations.

But in practice, the Joule heating and radiation of electromagnetic waves from

the circuit decrease the energy of the system. Therefore, the oscillations become damped oscillations.

**Note**

### Conservation of energy in LC oscillations

During _LC_ oscillations in _LC_ circuits, the energy of the system oscillates between the electric field of the capacitor and the magnetic field of the inductor. Although, these two forms of energy vary with time, the total energy remains constant. It means that _LC_ oscillations take place in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.

Let us consider 3 different stages of _LC_ oscillations and calculate the total energy of the system.

_U Q_

### Analogies between LC oscillations and simple harmonic oscillations

**Qualitative treatment** The electromagnetic oscillations of _LC_

system can be compared with the mechanical oscillations of a spring-mass system.

There are two forms of energy involved in _LC_ oscillations. One is electrical energy of the charged capacitor; the other magnetic energy of the inductor carrying current.

**Table 4.2 Energy in two oscillatory systems**

Likewise, the mechanical energy of the spring-mass system exists in two forms; the potential energy of the compressed or extended spring and the kinetic energy of the mass. The Table 4.2 lists these two pairs of energy.

By examining the Table 4.2, the analogies between the various quantities can be understood and these correspondences are given in Table 4.3.

The angular frequency of oscillations of a spring-mass is given by (Refer equation 10.22 of section 10.4.1 of XI physics text book).

ω = _k m_

From Table 4.3, _k C_→ 1 and _m L_→ . Therefore, the angular frequency of _LC_ oscillations is given by

ω = 1 _LC_(4.58)
