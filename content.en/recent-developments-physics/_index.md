**Most robots are composed of 3 main parts:**

**1\. e Controller ‚Äê also known as the "brain" which is run by a computer program. It gives commands for the moving parts to perform the job. 2. Mechanical parts - motors, pistons, grippers, wheels, and gears that make the robot move, grab, turn, and li. 3. Sensors - to tell the robot about its surroundings. It helps to determine the sizes and shapes of the objects around, distance between the objects, and directions as well.**
